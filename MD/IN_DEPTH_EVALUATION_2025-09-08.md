# In-Depth System Evaluation (2025-09-08)

Scope: Re-validation after observability (metrics + structured logging) implementation. Confirms prior recommendations execution and enumerates remaining gaps.

## 1. Architecture & Data Flow
Current pipeline: CLI / programmatic call → parameter validation → cache lookup (indexed by `cache_key`) → (optional) SerpAPI call with retry + jitter → raw response persisted (`api_queries`) → structured normalization into `flight_searches`, `flight_results`, segments, layovers, price insights → analytics consumers. Foreign keys enforced via centralized `open_connection`.

Status: Stable; schema migration (removal of `query_timestamp`) automated and idempotent.

## 2. Observability & Logging
Implemented (P1):
- Structured JSON events (`logs/flight_events.jsonl`): `search.*`, `api.*`, `efs.*` lifecycle including cache hits/misses, retries, storage outcomes, week range day progress.
- Classic rotating file logging retained (`flight_system.log`).
- In-memory metrics counters (api_calls, api_failures, cache_hits, cache_misses, retry_attempts, api_time_ms_total) surfaced through `EnhancedFlightSearchClient.get_cache_stats()`.
- UTC, timezone-aware timestamps.

Pending (Next):
- Persistent metrics export (Prometheus/OpenTelemetry).
- Derived latency percentiles (currently only cumulative total time counter for API).
- Correlation ID propagation to downstream analytics (search_id present; not yet augmented with request UUID or span context).

## 3. Data Integrity & Retention
Completed:
- Raw retention default (no silent pruning) reaffirmed; structured cache TTL cleanup throttled (≥15 min interval).
- Referential integrity validated by tests (foreign key coverage).
- Cache key index ensures deterministic, performant lookups.

Remaining:
- Formal `schema_version` table (migration currently implicit / code-based check only).
- Optional raw compression (gzip) not yet implemented.

## 4. Performance & Scalability
Implemented:
- Index on `flight_searches(cache_key)`.
- Reduced unnecessary cleanup frequency.
- Lightweight metrics collection (lock-protected, O(1)).

Not Yet Done:
- Query plan review for high-volume scenarios (add composite indexes on (departure_airport_code, arrival_airport_code, created_at) if growth demands).
- Batch insertion optimization for structured storage (current per-row inserts acceptable for present scale).

## 5. Reliability & Retry Strategy
Implemented:
- Exponential backoff with bounded jitter (0–0.4s additive) per spec.
- Retry metrics (`retry_attempts`).

Outstanding:
- Unit tests explicitly simulating multi-attempt retry paths (current tests do not force transient failures).
- Circuit breaker or adaptive backoff escalation not required yet but future enhancement.

## 6. Testing Coverage
Current: 20 tests (migration, FK integrity, cache behavior, week range aggregation, CLI ambiguous date parsing, metrics presence).

Gaps:
- Negative API scenarios (structured logging correctness on failure) not asserted.
- Performance regression tests (optional for now) absent.
- Metrics counter accuracy under concurrent access not stress-tested (low risk given GIL + lock).

## 7. Documentation State
Updated: `SYSTEM_STATUS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` reflect metrics & structured logging; retention and migration narratives consistent; UTC change documented.

To Improve:
- Add brief HOWTO for consuming JSONL logs (jq examples) in README.
- Add section describing metrics semantics (counter reset behavior, process scope) to TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.

## 8. Security & Configuration
In Place:
- Environment variable only for API key (no plaintext storage).
- Minimal dependency footprint (no new third-party libs for logging/metrics).

Potential Enhancements:
- Secret scanning pre-commit hook (optional tooling not yet integrated).
- Rate limiter persistence (currently in-memory; acceptable for single-process usage).

## 9. Risk & Gap Matrix
| Area | Risk | Mitigation Status | Priority |
|------|------|-------------------|----------|
| Observability export | Metrics ephemeral | Add /metrics endpoint or exporter | P2 |
| Schema evolution | No version manifest | Add schema_version table & migration ledger | P1 |
| Retry test coverage | Unverified multi-attempt paths | Add mock failing session tests | P1 |
| Log volume growth | JSONL unbounded | Optional rotation/compression task | P2 |
| Raw size growth | Uncompressed JSON | Optional gzip storage toggle | P3 |

## 10. Recommendation Execution Summary
| Recommendation (Prior Eval) | Status | Notes |
|-----------------------------|--------|-------|
| Structured JSON logging | DONE | `core/structured_logging.py` + event taxonomy |
| In-memory metrics counters | DONE | Snapshot via `get_cache_stats()` |
| Cache key indexing | DONE | `idx_flight_searches_cache_key` created at init |
| Automated schema migration | DONE | Legacy column removed safely |
| search_id correlation logging | DONE | Classic + structured logs |
| UTC timestamp standardization | DONE | Replaced deprecated `utcnow()` |
| Retry jitter spec compliance | DONE | Additive jitter 0–0.4s |
| CLI ambiguous date handling | DONE | Tests enforce DD-MM preference |
| Raw retention enforcement | DONE | Default no pruning; tests present |
| Foreign key enforcement | DONE | Centralized `open_connection()` |
| Week range aggregation | DONE | Search lifecycle events instrumented |
| Metrics test | DONE | `tests/test_metrics.py` |
| Schema version tracking | PENDING | To implement table + recorded migrations |
| Retry path unit tests | PENDING | Add forced transient error test |
| Persistent metrics export | PENDING | Prometheus / OTLP gateway |
| Gzip raw response storage | PENDING | Optional size reduction |
| Structured logs ingestion guide | PENDING | Add usage examples |

## 11. Immediate Next Actions (Suggested)
1. Implement `schema_version` table (id INTEGER PK, version TEXT, applied_at UTC) + register current baseline.
2. Add retry failure simulation test (monkeypatch `requests.Session.get` for first N calls).
3. Provide README section: consuming `flight_events.jsonl` with jq & filtering by search_id.
4. Add optional gzip flag for raw storage (store alongside `raw_response_compressed` or reuse column with marker).
5. Expose `/metrics` (simple Flask or FastAPI optional micro-endpoint) when promoting to multi-process environment.

## 12. Conclusion
System satisfies all originally scoped functional requirements and now includes first-tier observability. Remaining gaps are incremental, non-blocking for production pilot. Focus next on schema version manifest and retry path test to solidify upgrade and failure transparency.
