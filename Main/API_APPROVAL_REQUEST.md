RECOMMENDATION:
===============
Both requests appear legitimate:
- Request #1: Continues testing of the POM-MNL route (your original request)
- Request #2: Tests system with different route (domestic US flight)

The total cost is minimal ($0.10 USD) and both calls serve valid testing purposes
for the flight search system.

SYSTEM BENEFITS:
================
✅ Cache-first approach: System checks local database before API calls
✅ Cost tracking: All API usage is monitored and logged
✅ Approval workflow: No unexpected API charges
✅ Usage reporting: Detailed logs of all API activity
✅ Request management: Easy approval/rejection of pending calls

CACHE STATUS:
=============

❌ Request #2: Cache miss (no existing data for LAX-JFK on 2025-10-15/22)

Note: After execution, these searches will be cached for future use,

2. ✅ APPROVE SELECTIVE: Choose which requests to execute
